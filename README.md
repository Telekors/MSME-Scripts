# MSME-Scripts

I built the script based on a lot of the stuff andywalden is doing: https://github.com/andywalden/mfe_saw I recommend you check his stuff out. 

Essentially you feed this script a CSV file with a list of asset_ids and it will go through and delete them from ESM. **Be very careful with this, it could easily nuke your ESM server if you don't know what you are doing!!** I claim no responsibility if you trash your system.
